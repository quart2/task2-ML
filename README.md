# Customer Churn Prediction Task 2

## Objective
Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The model identifies customers likely to leave, helping businesses with retention strategies.

## Methodology
- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset (encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features).
- Developed a Logistic Regression model within a Scikit-learn pipeline.
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and F1-score.
- Saved the final pipeline for reuse.

## Key Results
- Accuracy: ~82.6%
- F1 Score: ~0.64
